Yesterday I had to the pleasure of going with some friends to the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve on the Pacific Coast of the San Francisco Peninsula.

My roommate Chris invited a bunch our friends from the Tri-Valley ward to the reserve at very low tide on February 9th. If there's one thing I've learned about Chris, it's his uncanny ability to pick beautiful days to go to the beach (see Lost Coast post). Statistically speaking, he's a hundred percent (please don't mind the sample size of n = 3).

We loaded up two vehicles and left Dublin at three in the afternoon. By the time we got to the beach, we had at least a solid hour of awesome sea-life viewing.

On the way home we went to dinner and had some awesome pizza at North Beach Pizza in San Mateo.

Check out the pictures from this trip below!
