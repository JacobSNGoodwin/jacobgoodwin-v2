For living in Redwood City, I infrequently go into town.

In the background you see evidence of the type of high density construction the Bay Area will inevitably need. From the Woodside railroad crossing the cranes cannot be missed.

Unfortunately, much of this construction will be "hip" luxury apartments. And what's more, I don't think these will be all bought up by the rich, but by engineers spending beyond their means.

This is what crosses my mind when I go for a stroll while I am getting my tires rotated and balanced.
