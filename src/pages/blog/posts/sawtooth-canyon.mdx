People from my home town in the desert have always raved about Sawtooth. Yet I had never passed by until this weekend on the drive back from church.

There weren't many campers out, probably on account of the cold. And there was only one small group of climbers. I would really like to head back out to that campground next time I have a few days off in my home town. It's been a good while since I've spent a night under the desert sky, contemplating my existence.

Here's a shot that Google Photos stitched together into a nice panorama!
