I just wanted to post some highlights of winter travel in the western US mostly from the early months of 2019. I originally posted this in 2019, but lost the post because I had some blog server issues and had failed to backup some articles.

## Seattle Snowmaggedon

I happened to show up to Seattle for the second of two major snow events in early 2019. These photos are from around the Seattle area on Feb 9-10, 2019.

## Trip to Mammoth

Shortly after the Seattle trip, I headed with mom for a quick trip to Bishop and Mammoth.
