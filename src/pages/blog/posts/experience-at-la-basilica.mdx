I have visited several major catholic sites, but this visit to the Villa de Guadalupe in Mexico City was a powerfully spiritual and emotional experience I hope to remember. So I write in the off chance four or five of you find this interesting. I also thank to girl on my Teotihuacan tour for recommending this site, as there was some chance I wasn't going to make it.

Upon first entering the complex of the Villa, I headed into the modern basilica where a mass was being held. A hope pervaded the room, and that emotion seemed to hit me hard. The choir sang along to a rumbling organ (that and tired feed are probably what drew me in) as worshipers waited for the meeting to begin. While there were lots of cameras and selfies going off, I found this more a sign of gladness than irreverence.

Finding this a comfortable place to take a rest, I continued to sit, as more and more of the church's leadership filled the room until a full security detail also began to enter with whom I can only guess are among the top local leadership of the church. During the meeting, a letter was read to whom I believed was the new head of this basilica. _Though, combing news articles, it would appear that Glennie Graue has already presided here for 5 years, and in January was assigned [5 more years](http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2016/01/09/presidira-glennie-graue-cinco-anos-mas-la-basilica-de-guadalupe-9122.html)._

I continued on to visit the numerous chapels and churches on this vast campus. Given the atmosphere and the sites, I can see why this is the top catholic pilgrimage site in the world.

I show some of my pictures below along with some information about the buildings, which I hope you'll enjoy. You can see all photos by opening the gallery below!
