I hadn't been to Big Basin State Park since August, 2013. That, of course, was late in the summer after a fairly dry winter.

Since there was a nice spring rain overnight, I decided to go check out the waterfalls at Big Basin while there was some serious runoff. I intended to take the Sunset, Berry Creek Falls, and Skyline-to-Sea loop, however the Berry Creek Trail and the Sunset Trail west of the Timms Creek Trail were closed from storm damage. And since I am a rule abiding fella, I was only able to see Berry Creek Falls.

Berry Creek Falls was as good as I had hoped from the outset, and you can see the difference in the falls three years ago versus today.

Either way, it was pleasant to get out and do a longer hike (around 10 miles), and to see the vast amount of water coming down the hillsides, the little streams forming into creeks.

I did have one mishap along the Skyline-to-Sea at a point where the trail had washed out and became tricky to navigate. Let's just say it was a sad day for my hiking poles.

And before I forget, Timms Creek Trail was bustling with little newt critters (or something similar) crossing the trail. I couldn't get any good photos, though. I shouldn't have packed my camera in my backpack.
