I wanted to highlight some recent visits to scenic Mojave Desert near home in Apple Valley, California.

## Juniper Flats

A few photos taken in Juniper Flats, a BLM area just south of Apple and Lucerne Valleys.

## Sidewinder Mountain

These photos were taken from a hike with my friend Marina to a random mountain off of Johnson Road between Apple and Lucerne Valley.

## Horseman Center

I took a day of to scramble and scratch my legs on some boulders at Horsemen's Center Park in Apple Valley

## Arrowhead Pinacles

I took a hike up the Arrowhead Pinacles in the desert transition region between Apple Valley and the San Bernardino Mountains. I did this hike with my nephew during fall 2018. We saw a film crew packing in lots of gear, but I have yet to determine what movie they filmed.
