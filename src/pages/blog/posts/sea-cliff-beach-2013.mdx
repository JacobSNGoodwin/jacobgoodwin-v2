Went down to Sea Cliff Beach for the first time for a regional YSA activity involving the stakes in the east bay. This time around a few folks from Santa Cruz and the South Bay even joined along. The weather at the Beach was spectacular. Some friends and I even took a pretty good swim out a good distance into the ocean. I snapped a few shots. This isn't anything too epic. But thought I'd throw the pictures up here for the handful that are interested in seeing them.

Do enjoy!
