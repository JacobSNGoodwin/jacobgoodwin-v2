### Interests

I enjoy a little of everything, though sadly there is never enough time to do it all, even if I were to quit my job. Many of my interests include:

- Religion
- Hiking, outdoors, and camping
- Music: guitar, piano, choral
- Blogging + a little web development for this blog

### Beliefs

I am a Mormon. Thus, I have devoted a page on this blog to my religious thoughts. I hope many readers can enjoy these thoughts, even if they agree with very little of it.

While I would never force my ideas on anyone, one will not understand me without understanding some of my basic beliefs. You can see my blog articles at the following link: [Beliefs](http://www.jacobsngoodwin.com/tag/beliefs/).

### Professional

I am trained as an Electrical Engineer, specifically in RF and microwave circuits with an emphasis on antenna simulation, design, and testing. I currently work as an application engineer for a computational electromagnetics company (yes, that is actually a job, though perhaps I could have never dreamed it up as a child).

I have previously worked for multiple government contractors, focusing mainly on design and testing of advanced microwave electronics.

I hold a BS in Electrical Engineering from UC Davis and an MS in Electrical Engineering from UCLA.
