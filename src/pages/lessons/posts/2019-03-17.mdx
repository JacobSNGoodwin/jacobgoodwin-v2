## Source Scriptures

### [Matthew 8-12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/8?lang=eng)

### [Mark 2-5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/2?lang=eng)

### [Luke 7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/7?lang=eng), [Luke 11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/11?lang=eng)

<InfoContainer title="Quick Summary">

Having passed through the temptation in the wilderness and delivered the sermon on the mount, Jesus begins His ministry in earnest around Galilee. He performs many miracles and teaches many parables. Examples of these miracles include raising the dead (son of widow, Jairus's daughter) along with healing the blind, a man with palsy (or paralyzed), one with a withered hand, a crazy man (men) with an unclean spirit, the centurions servant, and **a woman with an "issue of blood."**

Because of the many miracles He performs, Jesus is followed by crowds. Many in the crowds seek him out for healing, while others seem to watch and question Jesus's every move. Jesus uses these opportunities to teach many parables and deride the Pharisees.

Jesus also ordains the Twelve Apostles and describes their ministry to the lost sheep of the House of Israel.

## Warm Up - Reading the Scriptures

The scriptures, especially the New Testament, can be difficult to read for many reasons. While inspiration can be found in opening to a random verse and reading, I believe that if we first try to **literally understand** the scriptures **in context**, we will learn to appreciate them with greater depth and grow in our love of Christ.

### [Example - John 5:39](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/5.39?lang=eng#p39)

#### Reading Without Context

What does (or might) [John 5:39](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/5.39?lang=eng#p39) mean?

_I've gladly found that the seminary manuals have updated the teaching on this scripture!_

#### Adding the Context

<InfoContainer title="Context">

Jesus heals a man on the Sabbath. The man is caught carrying his bed and walking on the Sabbath by pharisees. Later, the man finds out it was Jesus and tells the pharisees.

v.16 - Jews confront and begin to persecute/harass Jesus.

v.17 - Jesus declares himself the Son of God

v.24 - Those who hear Jesus's word and believe in the Father have eternal life

</InfoContainer>

Now read [verses 37-40](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/5.37-40?lang=eng#p37), instead of just verse 39

<InfoContainer title="Better Interpretation">

Christ is addressing the pharisees.

What does Jesus say about the pharisees in verses 37-38?

Does verse 39 seem to say something contradictory to the whole of scripture and the words of prophets?

- In the scriptures they (we) _"think"_ that they (we) have eternal life? I thought they did contain what will bring eternal life... hmm...
- You are not alone. Thankfully, more modern translator believe that "search" may not be of the command form. See the Wayment translation below.

What are the pharisees failing to do according to verse 40?

What greater, more profound understanding do you have not that you understand the context of this scripture?

</InfoContainer>

<InfoContainer title="Helpful Translation">

From **The New Testament: A Translation for Latter-day Saints** - Thomas A. Wayment

**John 5: 39-40**

â€œYou search the scriptures because you think that you have eternal life in them, and yet it is they that testify concerning me, but you do not desire to come to me that you may have life."

## Class Study - Time Permitting

### Going to Heal Daughter of Jairus - [Mark 5:22-43](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/5.22-43?lang=eng#p22) - [Matthew 9:18-38](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/9.18-38?lang=eng#p18)

- Mark has most detailed account of woman with issue of blood and raising of Jairus's daughter
- Matthew 9 has more accounts of healing, with a poignant conclusion in 35-38

### Healing of Man With Palsy - [Matthew 9:2-8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/9.2-8?lang=eng#p2) - [Mark 2:3-12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/2.3-12?lang=eng#12) - [Luke 5:17-26](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/5.17-26?lang=eng#17)

### Gospel Revealed to Babes and Christ's Yoke - [Matthew 11:20-30](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/11.20-30?lang=eng#p20)

- See preface to D&C, [D&C 1:17-24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1?lang=eng).
  - One of the main purposes of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ is so that the weak things can break down the mighty and strong, and that everyone might speak in the name the Lord. This can be both humbling and empowering.
