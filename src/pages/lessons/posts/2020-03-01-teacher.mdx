## 2 Nephi 26-30

## Coming forth of the Book of Mormon

<InfoContainer title="Questions">

According to Nephi's prophecy, when will the Book of Mormon come forth?

Can we learn from the fact that the plates were shown in a miraculous manner to only a few witnesses?

Why does the Lord often do His work through the unlearned? Does he only use the unlearned?

In what ways can God speak to us aside from the words of The Bible?

[2 Nephi 26: 14-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.14-17?lang=eng#p14) - From the dust.

[2 Nephi 27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27?lang=eng#p9) - This scripture is referring to a book with a sealed portion the Lord will bring forth. This section is a bit confusing because it seems like sometimes the whole book is sealed, and sometimes like just a portion is sealed.

- 6 - Those who slumbered
- 9-10 - book delivered to a man who will deliver words, except a sealed portion
- 11 - Eventually sealed portion all things will be revealed upon the housetops
- 12-13 - Some witnesses will see the Book of Mormon
- 17-20, 26 - Learned will not be able to read the book. They will be taken a portion of the unsealed book, but desire to read the sealed portion. Lord will work through unlearned to do a marvelous work and a wonder.

[2 Nephi 29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29?lang=eng)

- 3 - We've already got one!
- 6-10 - God can _continually_ speak to more than one nation.
- 14 - Christ's word will be gathered in one.

## Lord's Chosen vs Apostasy

<InfoContainer title="Questions">

What do we learn about churches of gentiles? What can we learn from their mistakes to better follow the church of Christ?

Why does Isaiah compare those that fight zion and do iniquity to someone who dreams that they eat/drink, but they awake to find they're hungry/thirsty?

What philosophies do churches that don't follow Christ teach?

Who ultimately become the Lord's chosen people? (Think more broadly than Jews and gentiles)
