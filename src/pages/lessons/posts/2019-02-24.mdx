**Gather Together in One All Things in Christ**

_February 24, 2019 - Jacob Goodwin_

## Summary Points

- The principle of gathering together in one all things in Christ can assist us in changing checklists into a unified, integrated, and complete whole. This applies to...
  - the doctrine, and living, of the Gospel of Christ
  - the progression/trajectory of Church programs and initiatives
  - us as members of the Church, or _body_, of Christ
- Through Christ, we have access by one spirit to the Father
- This togetherness, framed together, grows up unto a holy temple in the Lord

<InfoContainer title="To Think About" type="orange">
 
  - What does gathering together in one all things in Christ look like for you on a daily basis?
  - What does gathering together in one all things in Christ look like for you on a daily basis?
  - Why can overly relying on checklists "divert us from drawing closer to the Lord"?
  - How do you remain focused on gospel living with fewer checklists and formal meetings?
  - How do you avoid the potential isolation of a home-centered church?
  - What will help us to get along, be unified, and grow in love? See Ephesians!

### [Gather Together in One All Things in Christ](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2018/10/gather-together-in-one-all-things-in-christ?lang=eng)

_Elder David A. Bednar - October 2018 General Conference - Saturday Morning Session_

<InfoContainer title="Intertwined Strands" type="blue">

Just as a rope obtains its strength from many intertwined individual strands, so the gospel of Jesus Christ provides the greatest perspective of truth and offers the richest blessings as we heed the admonition of Paul to “gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.”

**[Elder Bednar](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2018/10/gather-together-in-one-all-things-in-christ?lang=eng) gives two examples of _gathering together in one--even in Him_**

When listening to Elder Bednar speak, it's easy to miss the careful considerations and patterns of his messages. So let's read a little more carefully and see what we can learn!

- Example 1 - The fourth article of faith

- Example 2 - Church programs and initiatives

<InfoContainer title="Questions for each example" type="orange">

- What are the individual strands?
- When the strands are intertwined, how do they provide a greater perspective for truth?
- Does understanding this unified truth make a difference, or is it merely intellectually intriguing?

<InfoContainer title="An Apostolic Promise from Elder Bednar" type="blue">

I promise that increased perspective, purpose, and power will be evident in our learning and living of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as we strive to gather together in one all things in Christ—even in Him.

### [Ephesians](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph?lang=eng)

A principle theme of Ephesians is **"Christians, get along with each other!"** - [Daniel Wallace](https://bible.org/seriespage/ephesians-introduction-argument-and-outline)

This could be a pertinent lesson for our newly-formed ward.

For more on the body (church/followers) of Christ - [1 Corinthians 12-13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng)

<InfoContainer title="Ephesians 2 - Selected versus" type="blue">

8 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

9 - Not of works, lest any man should boast.

14 - For he is our peace, who hath made both one (referring to converts/gentiles and long-time disciples), and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;

18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:

<InfoContainer title="Ephesians 4 - Selected versus" type="blue">

1 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,

2 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;

3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;

5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.

7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;

15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:

16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
