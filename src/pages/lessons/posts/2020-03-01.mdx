## 2 Nephi 26-30

## Coming forth of the Book of Mormon

<InfoContainer title="Questions">

According to Nephi's prophecy, when will the Book of Mormon come forth?

What can we learn from the plates being shown in a miraculous manner to only a few witnesses?

Why does the Lord often do His work through the unlearned? Does He only use the unlearned?

In what ways can God speak to us aside from the words of The Bible?

[2 Nephi 26: 14-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.14-17?lang=eng#p14) - From the dust.

[2 Nephi 27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27?lang=eng#p9) - This scripture is referring to a book with a sealed portion the Lord will bring forth. This section is a bit confusing because it seems like sometimes the whole book is sealed, and other times like just a portion is sealed.

- 6 - Those who slumbered
- 9-10 - Book delivered to a man who will deliver words, except a sealed portion
- 11 - Eventually sealed portion and all things will be revealed upon the housetops
- 12-13 - Some witnesses will see the Book of Mormon
- 17-20, 26 - Learned will not be able to read the book. The learned will be taken a portion of the unsealed book, but desire to read the sealed portion. Lord will work through unlearned to do a marvelous work and a wonder.

[2 Nephi 29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29?lang=eng)

- 3 - We've already got one! (No a holy grail, but a bible)
- 6-10 - God can _continually_ speak to more than one nation.
- 14 - Christ's word will be gathered in one.

## Lord's Chosen vs Apostasy

<InfoContainer title="Questions">

What do we learn about churches of gentiles? What can we learn from their mistakes to better follow Christ's gospel?

Why does Isaiah compare those that fight zion and do iniquity to someone who dreams that they eat/drink, but awake to find they're still hungry/thirsty?

What philosophies do we and churches adopt when we're not based on Christ's doctrine?

Who ultimately become the Lord's chosen people? (Think more broadly than Jews and gentiles)
