## Warm Up - Reading the scriptures

The scriptures, especially, the NT, can be difficult to read in a variety of ways. While inspiration can be found in opening to a random verse and reading, I believe that if we first try to **literally understand** the scriptures, we will learn to appreciate them with greater depth and grow in our love of Christ and His gospel. I'll give an example here, and we may look at others on different occasions!

### [Example - John 5:39](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/5.39?lang=eng#p39)

#### Reading without Context

What does (or might) John 5:39 mean?

_In my day, this was a seminary scripture mastery. It is not anymore. I can tell you that the meaning we were supposed to take from the scripture failed to show to show the true depth of Jesus's message._

#### Adding the Context

<InfoContainer title="Context">

Jesus heals a man on the Sabbath. The man is caught carrying his bed and walking on the Sabbath by pharisees. Later, the man finds out it was Jesus and tells the pharisees.

v.16 - Jews confront and begin to persecute/harass Jesus.

v.17 - Jesus declares himself the Son of God

v.24 - Those who hear Jesus' word and believe in the Father have eternal life

</InfoContainer>

Now read [verses 37-40](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/5.37-40?lang=eng#p37), instead of just verse 39

<InfoContainer title="Better Interpretation">

Christ is addressing the pharisees.

What does Jesus say about the pharisees in verses 37-38?

Does verse 39 seem to say something contradictory to the whole of scripture and the words of prophets?

- In the scriptures they (we) _"think"_ that they (we) have eternal life? I thought they did contain what will bring eternal life... hmm...
- You are not alone. Thankfully, more modern translator believe that "search" may not be of the command form. See the Wayment translation below

What are the pharisees failing to do according to verse 40?

What greater, more profound understanding do you have not that you understand the context of this scripture?

<InfoContainer type="orange" title="Helpful Translation">
  
From **The New Testament: A Translation for Latter-day Saints** - Thomas A. Wayment

**John 5: 39-40**

â€œYou search the scriptures because you think that you have eternal life in them, and yet it is they that testify concerning me, but you do not desire to come to me that you may have life."

## Notes on scriptures

### Matthew 8

- This is after the sermon on the mount - Also see [Luke 7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/7?lang=eng)
- v.1-4 - Jesus heals a leper in Capernaum
  - Simplicity of the language and request to be healed is stark
  - One of the cases where man is told not to tell anybody
- v.5-13 - Heals a centurions servant with palsy (note major differences with Luke 7)
  - v.6-7 - Jesus offers to go Centurion's home, but Centurion doesn't feel worthy
  - v.8-9 - Centurion suggests that Jesus can command, and servant will be healed
  - v.10-11 - Jesus commends great faith of centurion and alludes to gospel going to all people!
    - What lessons might you take from this?
    - For me, this parable says a lot about the ability of all people, no matter their status or culture to come unto Christ and receive healing from him
  - v.13 - Servant healed in selfsame hour
- v.14-15 - Heals Peter's mother in law, who then ministers to "them"
- v.16-17 - Heals others possessed and sick to fulfill words of Isaiah
- v.18-22 - Jesus tells crowd to cross water
  - v.19-22 emphasize the difficulty and challenge of being a disciple. Jesus may be trying to emphasize the challenge of following him
    - Son of man has not where to lay his head
    - Let the dead bury their dead
- v.23-27 - Jesus rebukes the waves of the sea
  - What manner of man is this, that even the seas obey him!
- v. 28-34 - Jesus casts devils out of two men that are supposedly so wild people can't pass them on the road
  - Jesus sends them into swine, which drown themselves.
  - Townspeople beg Jesus to leave

### Matthew 9

- v.1 - At this point Jesus appears to have made His home Capernaum [Matthew 4:13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/4.13?lang=eng#p13)
  - This makes more sense since Nazareth is a ways from the Sea of Galilee
  - [Mark 2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/mark/2?lang=eng) also describes event at Capernaum
- v.2 - Jesus forgives man with palsy brought to him on a bed
  - Instead of healing directly
- v.3-4 - Jesus perceives thoughts of pharisees
- v.5 - Is it easier to say, "your sins are forgiven" or "arise and walk"?
  - Maybe it is easier to say "Arise and walk."
- v.6 - But Jesus wants to teach that he has the power to forgive sins
  - Now Jesus commands man to arise and walk
- v.7-8 - Jesus departs and people marvel
- v.9 - Only mention of Matthew the tax collector being called **as a disciple**
- v.10-12 - Jesus dines at Matthew's house.
  - They that are sick need a physician
- v.13 - Mercy is more important than sacrifice
- v.14-17 - Why Jesus's disciples don't fast (not the easiest to understand)
  - New cloth on old and new wine in old bottles. Jesus's teachings don't need to be caught up in old traditions or focuses.
  - Does this mean fasting is not important?

#### The busy day - 18-38

- v.18-19 - Jesus and disciples head to ruler's daughter who has died
- v.20-22 - Woman with "issue of blood"
  - Jesus responds with compassion, and probably in a non culturally acceptable way given her uncleanliness and that she is a woman
- v.24 - Jesus laughed to score for saying the maiden is not dead
- v.25 - Raises ruler's daughter from the dead
  - v.26 - fame spreads
- v.27-31 - Heals two blind me
  - Men told to tell no one, but they do anyway
- v.32-33 - Heals "dumb" man possessed with devil
  - Another case of people marvelling, which seems to be something Matthew wants us to know
- v.35 - Jesus teaches, preaches, and heals
- v.36-38 - **Is compassionate of the people, sees them as a sheep with no shepherd**
  - People need spiritual guidance. The harvest is great, but the laborers are few
  - Sometimes people mock religion for being something for the weak and needy. They think of this as a negative, but in fact, it's a positive if God is real.

### Matthew 10 - Call and Charge of Apostles

_The next three chapters are pretty harsh_

- v.1 - First mention of twelve is about their call and post to cast out spirits and to heal
  - **Is this something we think about when we think of the twelve?**
- v.2-4 - Simon Peter, Andres (brother), James and John (sons of Zebedee, or thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the Publican, James the son of Alphaeus, Lebbaeus Thatdaeus, Simon the Canaanite, Judas Iscariot
- v.5-6 - Only go to lost sheep of Israel
- v.7 - Preach the Kingdom is at hand (testify of Christ)
- v.8 - Healing

#### Apostles Will Face A Lot

- v.14-15 - The shaking the dust off of the feet missionaries love so much
- v.16 - Be wise as serpents, but harmless of doves
- v,19-20 - Take no thought - spirit speaks in you
- v.22 - Hated, but endure to be saved
- v.24-25 - Servant is not above the master - if they called Jesus Satan, you'll get the same
  - Reminds of liberty jail, "Are though better that He?"
- v.31 - Fear not
- v.34-39 - Christ will divide since we need to love Him above all. Must take up our cross and lose our lives for Christ's sake
- v.40-42 - Receiving the apostles is receiving the Lord

### Mathew 11

- v.2-3 - John sends disciples to Jesus
- v.4-5 - Jesus tells them to go tell John the things they have or will witness
- v.9 - "What went ye to see? A prophet?" John more than a prophet
- v.10 - John is he of who it is written "Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
- v.11 - None among men greater than John
- v.14 - This is Elias
- v.16-19- **Parable of children in markets calling to fellows**
  - Children piped and called to fellows, who have not come.
  - Yet John and Jesus came in different manners, and they still won't believe
- v.20-24 - Woes unto cities where Jesus does miracles, but they do not believe
- v.25 - **Thanks Father that gospel is hidden from wise and prudent and given to babes**
- v.27-30 - Take my yoke up you
  - Our own wisdom is nothing compared to having Christ to help carry our burdens

### Matthew 12

- v.1-8 - Corn on Sabbath incident see Mark 2
  - v.7 - I will have mercy, and not sacrifice
- v.10-15 - Heals man with withered hand. Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?
  - v.16-21 - How this fulfills prophecy
- v.22-23 - Heals blind and dumb. Is not this the son of David?
- v.24-28 - Accusation the he casts out spirits by Beelzebub
- v.30 - He that is not with me is against me
- v.31-32 - Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost
- v.34 - Generation of vipers. How can ye, being evil, speak good things?
- v.38-41 - Pharisees ask for sign. And evil and adulterous nation seeks a sign
  - The asking for a sign isn't necessarily mentioned in the other chapters
  - Will give sign of Jonas - Will be three nights and three days the earth as Johah was in whale
  - But people of Nineveh will cry out against this generation because they repented not with an even greater prophet
- v.43-45 - Confusing parable. Almost like "misery loves company." A bad spirit gathers more

#### Who is Jesus's Family?

- v.46-50 - Who is my mother, and who is my brother?
  - v.50 - Those who do will of Father

### Mark 2

- v.1 News gets out of Jesus's location in Capernaum

  - Jesus forgives after seeing faith (same as in Matthew)
  - Has power to forgive and heal
  - v.12 - Man takes up his bed
- v.14-17 - Jesus calls Levi (probably Matthew's hebrew name), who's at the "receipt of custom" to follow him
  - Rest of account is similar to Matthew
- v18-22 - Fasting question by John's disciples, similar to Matthew account
- v.23-29 - Sabbath made for man, and not man for the Sabbath
  - Pharisees question disciples plucking of corn
  - The Sabbath, like the corn is to provide for our needs, is what I think this means

### Mark 3

#### Heals on Sabbath

- v.1-6 - Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?
  - Jesus heals man with withered hand, angering the pharisees who look for ways to destroy him
- v.7-12 - Great multitude from many places presses up Jesus
  - Heals many plagues and unclean spirits
  - Even he needs a little space
  - **Does this teach us anything about us as mortals?**
  - See versus 20-21 where family is concerned he doesn't even eat

#### Ordains Apostles - Short Description

- v.13-19 - Goes to mountain and ordains apostles
  - They're to preach and heal
- v.22-26 - A house divided against itself cannot stand
- v.27 - Parable of the strong man
- v.28-30 - Blasphemies against the Holy Ghost
  - Jesus says it because he is accused of having an unclean spirit
  - So maybe he's warning about denying his true power which must only be denied by denying the Holy Ghost

#### Family Worries about Jesus

- v.20-21 - _Family concerned Jesus isn't even eating_
- v.31-35 - Worried family still looking for Jesus, apparently
  - Jesus's family are those who do the will of God

### Mark 4

- v.1 - I wonder logistically how preaching from the sea would work

#### Sower

- v.3-20 - Parable of the sower with explanation
  - Probably won't cover in class as it is over covered in church and seminary
  - v.10-12 - Reason for parables. Why would Jesus not want people to receive forgiveness? Isn't that one of His main purposes?
    - [Matthew 13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/13?lang=eng) shows Jesus giving parables as fulfilling of prophecy
    - Another example of a confusing scripture

#### Candle

- v.21-22 - Candle is not hidden
  - The message here is not just to let our light shine before men, but that everything will be brought to light
  - Therefore, we can extend that we should let our light shine in a positive way because it will be made manifest
- v.24-25 - Those that hear will receive more

#### Seed Cast into Ground

- v.26-29 - Kingdom of God rises suddenly like the seed cast into the ground, it springs forth, even though he don't know how
  - Maybe spiritual things don't always have a great explanation

#### Mustard Seed - 30-32

- v.30-32 - Parable of the mustard seed
- v.33-34 - Jesus doesn't speak without speaking in parables
- Expounds things to disciples in privacy

- v.38 - Care thou not that we perish?
- v.40 - How is it that ye have no faith?
- v.41 - Disciples fear

### Mark 5

#### Crazy Man in Gadarenes - 1-19

- This account talks about man cutting himself and being wild and ferocious
- Only one man in this account and Luke, two in Matthew
- v.7 - Man doesn't want to be healed here, Jesus directly tries to heal him
- v.9 - Name is legion
- v.15-17 - People afraid when seeing man in his right mind, pray Jesus depart
- v.18-20 - Man desires to be with Jesus, who instead tells him to testify to people.
  - Man publishes throughout Decapolis which is mostly modern-day Jordan

- v.43 - Interesting that Jesus commands her to eat
  - Jesus has a knowledge of your temporal needs

### Luke 7

#### Centurions Servant Healed - 1-10

- Note differences with [Matthew 8](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/8?lang=eng)
  - v.2 - servant ready to die
  - v.3 - Sends elders of the Jews to Jesus to ask Jesus to come heal
    - different in Matthew, where centurion turns down Jesus
  - v.4-5 - Here, Jews tout worthiness of centurion because has built a synagogue
  - v.6 - Centurion sends friends to Jesus to tell him he's not worthy to have him in his house
  - v.7 Nor did he feel worthy to go himself, differing from Matthew. But he suggests Jesus can just say it, and his servant will be healed
  - v.9 - Jesus commends faith
  - v.10 - Servant healed

#### Raises Son of Widow of Nain from the Dead - 11-17

- Raises by merely touching the bier
  - In this case, Jesus also see the crowd and shows compassion
  - v.16 - "A great prophet has risen among us!"

#### Messengers from John the Baptist - 18-34

- John sends men to see if man doing miracles is "the one to come"
- v.21-22 - Jesus performs miracles and tells men to testify of what they've seen
- v.22-27 - What did you go out to see?
- v.26-28 - John was even more than a prophet - he was Elias, send to prepare the way of the Lord
- v.31-35 - Parable of children sitting in marketplace
  - Maybe the meaning is that God called them in poverty and being humble, and they didn't respond. Jesus is liberal and open, drinking and hanging out with tax collectors, and they also won't listen

#### Sinful Woman with Ointment and Parable to Two Debtors- v.36-50

  - Cross ref Matthew 7

#### Beelzebub Accusation - 17-23

- v.17 - Kingdom divided cannot stand
- v.19-23 - Parable of strong man

#### Parable of Unclean Spirit - 24-26

- v.27 - Blessed are those that hear and keep the word of God

#### Sign of Jonah - 29-32

- Jesus is greater than Jonah, and people still won't believe. People of Nineveh will testify against this generation

#### Light of the Body - 33-36

- Whole body should be full of light
  - Should be inwardly and outwardly righteous

#### Dining with Pharisees

  - v.42 - **Love rules but neglect justice and the love of God**
