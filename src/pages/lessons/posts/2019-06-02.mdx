## The Lord Judges by the Desires of Our Hearts

<InfoContainer title="To Consider">

In what ways are you or your friends judged by your appearance (positively or negatively)? Do people sometimes set certain expectations of you because of your religion or standards?

What can you learn from how Zacchaeus lived (v.8)? What things matter most to the Lord?

Is it wrong to be _outwardly righteous_?

- Zacchaeus - [Luke 19:1-10](https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/19.1-10?lang=eng#p1)

## How (not) to Be

<InfoContainer title="To Consider">

_From Come, Follow Me--For Individuals and Families_

If you ever feel overwhelmed as you strive to follow Jesus Christ, the Savior’s words to the lawyer in Matthew 22 can help you simplify and focus your discipleship. Here’s one way to do this: Make a list of several of the Lord’s commandments. How does each item on your list connect to the two great commandments? How would focusing on the two great commandments help you keep the others?

_Bonus_

Are there rules, expectations, or culture in the church that, if taken to an extreme, can make us lose sight of the two great commandments?

- Greatest Commandment in the Law - [Matthew 22:34-40](https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22.34-40?lang=eng#p34), [Mark 12: 28-34](https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/12.28-34?lang=eng#p28)

- Woes unto the Pharisees and Scribes - [Matthew 23](https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/23?lang=eng)

  - v.13 - Shut up the kingdom of heaven against men
  - v.14 - Make long prayers for show
  - v.23 - '...for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."
  - v.25 - Clean on the outside, but full of extortion and excess on the inside

## When We Come Up Short

- Rich ruler (from previous lesson) - [Mark 10:17-27](https://www.lds.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10.17-27?lang=eng#p17)
