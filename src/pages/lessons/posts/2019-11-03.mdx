## Topics

### Disciples and Ministers of the Gospel

1 Thessalonians 1-2 refer to the faith of the saints there, and also about how Paul, Silas, and Timothy went about preaching the gospel there. [1 Thessalonians 1: 5-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-thes/1.5-10?lang=eng), [1 Thessalonians 2:1-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-thes/2.1-12?lang=eng)

- How/why does our individual example matter? How does our example as a congregation matter?
- What are some important characteristics we should strive for when taking the gospel to others? How about when others come to us (for example, at church)?
  - Maybe you can think of some examples of how others have positively influenced you.
- [2 Thessalonians 3:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-thes/3.1?lang=eng), [1 Timothy 2:1-2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/2.1-2?lang=eng) - the importance of prayer for others ministering the gospel
- [Titus 3:1-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/titus/3.1-8?lang=eng&id) on receiving the spirit through baptism

### Apostasy

[2 Thessalonians 2:1-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-thes/2.1-4?lang=eng), [2 Timothy 4:3-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.3-5?lang=eng)

- How do these scriptures relate to the Great Apostasy?
  - What is _The Great Apostasy_?
- What do these scriptures tell us about falling away in general? How does it happen? What are itching ears?
- [2 Timothy 3:1-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.1-7?lang=eng) talks about perilous times in the last days, [v. 14-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.14-17?lang=eng) show one way to deal soundly with these perils. Also see [2 Timothy 1:5-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.5-10?lang=eng)
  - How are these characteristics manifested today at school, community, and maybe even at church? How do we guard against them?
  - I see some dangers with the speed of life and social media in my generation as promoting some of these negative qualities. Hopefully your generation is healthier in this regard.

### Christ Desires to save

[1 Timothy 1: 15-16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/1.15-16?lang=eng), [1 Timothy 2:1-6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/2.1-6?lang=eng)

Christ wants to save all, even sinners. Paul shares his testimony that he was foremost among sinners

### The Importance of Work

[1 Thessalonians 4:11-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-thes/4.11-12?lang=eng), [2 Thessalonians 3:7-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-thes/3.7-13?lang=eng), [1 Timothy 5:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/5.8?lang=eng)

- Why is working for a living important? How can it relate to spirituality?
- What about those, especially in poor countries who struggle to provide? Are these scriptures harsh?

- v.4-6 - Paul's testimony of Christ
- v.11-15 - Wayment: _These teachings are tied to a historical situation that is no longer known or understood. It remains unclear why Paul would instruct women to remain silent and to learn in all obedience. From the tone of the verses, it appears that Paul was attempting to settle a dispute in the community, although these verses may represent common cultural attitudes. The fact that Paul uses the sequence of Eve’s creation as an argument that she is inferior to Adam does not represent the Genesis account or other scriptural teachings (compare 1 Corinthians 14: 34– 35)_

#### [Chapter 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/4?lang=eng)

- v.3-4 - Similar language, though more permissive than modern Word of Wisdom. Perhaps the principal is that we should receive bounty of the earth with thanksgiving.

#### [Chapter 5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/5?lang=eng)

- v.8 - Really hard scripture that probably many of our parents have dealt with. At the end of the day, though, parents are responsible to do all in their power to care for those of their house.

- v.3-4 - People will eventually not endure sound doctrine but turn to their own lusts
- v.6-8 - Paul ready to be "offered" - having fought the good fight and having kept the faith
  - A crown of righteousness awaits

### Titus

#### [Chapter 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/titus/1?lang=eng)

- v.2- God made promise of eternal life before the world began (maybe we can say that he provided a savior)
- v.8-9 - More about qualifications of a Bishop
  - Interesting that some very basic qualities such as temperate, doesn't get angry and drunk, and faithful are include
  - Must also be able to reason with gainsayers (deniers and contrarians)
- v.10-15 - Supposedly some of these deceivers "of the circumcision" (believers? Jews? :man_shrugging:)
  - One "prophet" professed against Cretans (seems literal people from Crete in this case). This is opposed to gospel being available to Gentiles.
- v.16 - Some profess to know God, but in their works deny him

#### [Chapter 2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/titus/2?lang=eng)

- v.1 - Speak sound doctrine
- v.3 - Interesting here that Titus should teach with the end that aged women can they themselves teach "good things." Maybe this is outside of the church only, but women don't keep complete silence, at the very least.
- v.7 - Show yourself a pattern of good works
- v.8-11 - Grace of God for all, including servants. They should be faithful to masters, not stealing from them

#### [Chapter 3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/titus/3?lang=eng)

- v.8 - Be careful to maintain good works

### Philemon

#### [Chapter 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng)

- v.1 - Paul (in prison) and Timothy to Philemon
- v.7 - Philemon has refreshed the saints
- v.9-13 - Philemon encouraged to receive Onesimus, who was apparently not useful before in preaching the gospel. Perhaps he has repented or resolved issues with Paul
- v.10 - This apparently means that Onesimus was converted by Paul in prison
- v.13 - this verse suggests Onesimus was Philemon's servant, and Paul thought about keeping him for himself.
- v.14 - Do things willingly, and not of necessity. This has the ring of doing this with heart and a willing mind.
- v.16 - Philemon encouraged to receive Onesimus as a brother, more than a servant/slave
- v.18 - Paul says that in Onesimus owes Philemon anything, that it's on Paul himself
  - Evidently Onesimus might have stolen from his master, Philemon, in the past
