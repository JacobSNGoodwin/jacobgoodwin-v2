## 1 Nephi 16-22

### Summary

Lehi's family finds the Liahona and is guided south-southeast through the desert (probably modern Saudi Arabia since they were previously on the border of the Red Sea). Ishmael dies. Nephi's bow breaks. Group lives on raw meat and many children are born. They arrive at Bountiful at the sea shore. Nephi commanded to build ship after the manner of the Lord. Brothers mock Nephi and even try to throw him into the sea after he berates them with speech comparing their experience to children of Israel leaving Egypt. They complete the ship and set sail. Family "lifted up unto exceeding rudeness" on boat. Laman and Lemuel bind Nephi with cords for warning family. Only wrath of God causes family to loosen Nephi. They arrive at the promise land. Nephi explains the making of records. He then teaches from Isaiah passages with the purpose of "likening all scripture unto [them]." Nephi's brothers ask for interpretation of Isaiah, which Nephi gives.

### Summary of last week - 1 Nephi 11-15

Nephi is "caught away" in the Spirit of the Lord to a high mountain. The spirit asks Nephi questions about the plan of salvation, showing and guiding Nephi (Look!) to witness the birth (sees Mary in Nazareth), life, ministry, and atonement of the Lamb of God, the apostasy and restoration of the Israel (Lehi's descendants included). During this vision, elements of Lehi's dream of the Tree of Life are interspersed and related to the plan of salvation.

#### ... and lots of notes

- [1 Nephi 11:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.11?lang=eng#p11) - Nephi speaks to the Spirit of the Lord as one man speaks to another.
  - Some argue that Nephi was speaking with the Holy Ghost, fewer that he spoke with the pre-mortal Lord. I suppose it could be another angel, too.
- [1 Nephi 12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12?lang=eng) - Nephi sees the land of promise and the destruction and upheaval of many great cities. He sees his seed overcome by the seed of his brothers, who then dwindle in unbelief.
- [1 Nephi 13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng) - Formation of great and abominable church and gentiles arrival and prosperity in the Land of Promise.
  - Desires of church are fine gold, silver, fine materials and clothing, harlots, praise of the world.
  - [v.20-29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.20-29?lang=eng#20) - Bible brought to the land of promise with missing/perverted truths and removed covenants.
  - [v.37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.37?lang=eng#37) - "Blessed are those who seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost"
  - [v.39-41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.39-41?lang=eng#39) - Other books convince gentiles, Jews, and Lehi's posterity of bible and Lamb of God.
- [1 Nephi 14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng) - Gospel will go to all the earth (though numbers are few, v.12). Church of the Lamb armed with righteousness. Nephi see's the vision of John (what we know as the Book of Revelation or Apocalypse), though he is forbidden to write it down.
- [1 Nephi 15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng) - Nephi imparts his knowledge to his brothers who are disputing what their father has told them. He teaches them the importance of asking the Lord and explains spiritual and temporal meaning of elements of Lehi's vision
  - [v.5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.5?lang=eng#p5) - Interesting that Nephi has to answer questions at the same time he is trying to confront his own grief for having seen his posterity destroyed.
  - [v.11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.11?lang=eng#p11) - in some record or revelation, the brothers must have been taught to inquire of the Lord since Nephi asks "Do ye not remember...?"
  - [v.16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.16?lang=eng#p16) - Grafting into the olive tree of original branches

# This Week's Lesson

<InfoContainer title="To Think About">

What are some adversities you guys face?

What can you learn from this account to help you deal with this adversity? What actions and thoughts are useful? What actions or thoughts are detrimental?

What are some ways you seek God's guidance? Nephi went to the mount oft while building the ship.

What are some ways God guides you? Are there some ways you may be overlooking or taking for granted?

Laman and Lemuel forget again and again. They even publicly recognize the Lord and then forget. How do we forget?

## The Wilderness - [1 Nephi 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16?lang=eng)

- After Lehi and Ishmael's family intermarry, they find the Liahona
- v.10 - They find the Liahona. First spindle points where to go. Second spindle... :thinking:?
- v.14 - Family travels near the borders of the Red Sea following Liahona's directions, slaying food along the way
- **v.18** - Nephi breaks his steel bow
  - Interesting how often Nephi comments on metals (Laban's sword, plates, Liahona, bow, ore for ship tools). Either he had experience going into the journey, or he had learned a lot by the time he wrote his account in the land of promise.
- **v.20** - Family murmurs, including Lehi.
- **v.23** - Nephi makes a simple bow and a single arrow, along with a sling, asks father where he should go hunting.
- **v.27-29** - Pointers work according to faith. A new writing also appears. By small means.
  - Words written on the ball cause Lehi to fear and tremble
  - I don't think of the Liahona itself as small means. It seems pretty amazing. But maybe I'm missing something. Help me out!
- v.34-40 - Ishmael dies. Many family members desire to return to Jerusalem and Laman and Lemuel plot to kill Lehi and Nephi :man_facepalming:. The Lord (not necessarily through Nephi this time), chastens Laman and Lemuel exceedingly.

## Building the Ship in Bountiful - [1 Nephi 17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng)

- v.1-4 - God blesses family in the wilderness as they eat raw meat and have children over an 8 year period.
- v.5 - They arrive in Bountiful on the sea, which seems like a better place than the middle of the Arabian desert.
- **v.7-10** - Nephi commanded to go to a high mountain where he receives the commandment to build a ship.
  - Why would the Lord call Nephi to the mountain?
- **v.13** - Family didn't make fire in the wilderness, partially as a testament that God was their light and guide to the promised land.
  - Does God sometimes lead us in seemingly "non-intuitive" paths so that we'll recognize Him?
- v.17-19 - Laman and Lemuel murmur, then revel in Nephi's sorrow.
  - Do we ever feel like others like seeing us struggle, and how do we react?
- v.22 - Laman and Lemuel assert that people at Jerusalem were a righteous people
  - While our account of Lehi shows him testifying of Christ and general wickedness in Jerusalem, contemporary Jeremiah condemned Israel for specifically turning from the Law of Moses and seeking after Baal (instead of Jehovah). He also condemned them of sacrificing their children to the God Molech [Jeremiah 32:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/32.35?lang=eng#35).
- v.23-51 - Comparison of family to Moses leading children of Israel
  - **v.33-35**, 40 - God favors the righteous and gives them a land of promise, even while he "esteemeth all flesh in one."
  - v.45 - L&L swift to do iniquity but slow to remember God
- v.48-55 - Leman and Lemuel desire to throw Nephi into the sea. He shocks them, and they declare that it was the power of the Lord.
  - v.53-55 - Lord shocks Laman and Lemuel so they're recognize the Lord. This parallels the speech Nephi just gave.

## Sailing - [1 Nephi 18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng)

- v.1-8 - Nephi finishes ship after manner of the Lord. Family is humbled (again). They gather grains and enter ship.
  - **v.3** - He goes to the mount oft. The Lord shows him great things.
  - Do you think Nephi only learned about the ship? What are your mounts?
- v.9-11 - Nephi bound with cords for warning of family's rudeness.
- v.12-20 - Only the power of God threatening ship's destruction caused family to soften hearts and loose Nephi.
  - v.16 - Nephi still praises and doesn't murmur.
- v.21-25 - Nephi loosed and family guided to promised land where they plant and use natural resources.

## Nephi Makes Plates and Testifies of Christ - [1 Nephi 19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng)

- v.1-6 - Nephi makes two sets of plates after arriving in promised land
  - Nephi engraved record of his father on first plates (Large Plates).
  - Second plates for ministry, prophecies, and plain and precious parts
  - v.4 - concept of continuing prophets to guard the large plates
  - **v.6-7** - Small plates for the sacred
- v.8-19 - Prophecy of Jesus Christ
  - Prophecy of Christ's birth in 600 years
  - Jesus will suffer and be lifted up on the cross
  - References prophecies of Zenock, Neum, and Zenos, who are only referenced in BoM
  - Prophecy of natural disasters upon Jesus's death
  - **v.15-17** - God will remember his covenant and gather Israel. All the earth will see the salvation of the Lord (Nephi is referencing Zenos)
- **v.22-24** - Nephi teaches from the plates of brass and words of Isaiah
  - To persuade us to believe in the Lord
  - To Liken scriptures to us
  - That we may have hope

## Isaiah Quotations - [1 Nephi 20-21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/20?lang=eng)

Nephi quotes these to his family

### [1 Nephi 20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/20?lang=eng)

- **v.1** - Hearken, O House of Jacob
- **v.2-6** - How do we actually become a holy city instead of taking it for granted?
  - Can we deny the works of God in our lives and our church?
- v.16 - God hath not spoken in secret.
- **v.16-21** - What are the consequences of obeying God?
  - What does peace like a river, righteousness like waves look like?
  - Above is example of poetic Isaiah. Another classic example is "though your skins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."

### [1 Nephi 21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21?lang=eng)

- **v. 14-16**, **19-22** - God will restore his people in such abundance that there won't be space in the land to contain them, and they'll wonder how that is possible. The gentiles will carry Israel in their arms.

<InfoContainer title="Likening scriptures">

These Isaiah passages may literally be talking about God delivering Israel out of captivity, but Nephi likened them to his family.

How do these scriptures relate to Lehi's family?

How can you relate these scriptures to you?

What sort of hope do these scriptures give us? Recall that this was one purpose Nephi cites Isaiah.

## Nephi's Explanation of Isaiah - [1 Nephi 22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng)

- v.1-3 - Brethren ask Nephi what the Isaiah passages he cited meant. Are they spiritual or temporal?
  - Reminiscent of their asking what Lehi's dreams meant
  - Things are temporal and spiritual. Nations will be literally scattered through the earth.
- v.6 - Israel will be nursed by the gentiles
- v.8 - Lord will do a marvelous work among the gentiles of great worth to Lehi's seed
- v.10 - Earth can only be blessed if Lord makes bare his arm
- v.13 - Great and abominable church will die by their own sword
- v.15 - Second Coming / Millennium Prophecy. Satan will have no more power and wicked will burn
- v.21 - Lord will raise up a prophet, the Holy One of Israel
- v.25-28 - There shall be one fold and one shepherd. Safety for those that repent
- v.31 - Endure to the end and be saved
