## Themes/Impressions/Teachings/Accounts

- Sometimes it's easy to judge those who seem to have it better off than us or those in power. Jesus definitely decried hypocrisy, but what does Zacchaeus teach us? Should we be outwardly obedient? What do you do on a day to day basis when people maybe have their hypocrisy radar on? How does this story give confidence?

## Other

I also maybe wanted to revisit Jesus and the rich young man

- With God, all things are possible
