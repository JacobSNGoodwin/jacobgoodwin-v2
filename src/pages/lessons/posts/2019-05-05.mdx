## Introduction

What is something interesting you've learned in the month and a half since we met? Also, how ya been?

[Luke 10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/10?lang=eng)

Jesus calls seventy to act in His name. He answers the question, "who is my neighbor?"

[John 7-10](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/7?lang=eng)

Jesus attends the [Feast of the Tabernacles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot). In these chapters we find many who wonder and debate Jesus's authenticity (or even just whether he's good). Jesus testifies of his divinity, calling himself "the good shepherd." He tells us how we can know if He is really the Son of God. He shows and teaches how to act and judge righteously.

<InfoContainer type="orange" title="Questions to Ponder">

What are some ways we judge others unfairly or unrighteously? What can we learn from Jesus's example and teachings?

How can we handle situations when we feel like there's chatter going on about us, or even in "noisy situations" in general? Though we are not Jesus, what characteristics did he have that would help us in such situations?

How can we gain a testimony that Jesus is real and that following him will matter?

## Coming to Know Christ

#### [John 7:14-17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/7.14-17?lang=eng#p14)

We can know Christ's teachings are from God if we follow them.

#### [John 7:38-39](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/7.38-39?lang=eng#p39)

Does the spirit flow from me? What if I feel like I trying, though, and this doesn't seem to happen?

#### [John 8:12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/8.12?lang=eng#p12)

If we follow Christ we'll have the light of life.

#### [John 8:58](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/8.58?lang=eng#p58)

Before Abraham was, I am.

#### [John 10:9-18, 27](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/10.9-18,27?lang=eng#p9) - Poignant

Christ is the door and the good shepherd. He gives life that is more abundant.

## Judgement

#### [John 7:23-24](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/7.23-24?lang=eng#p23)

Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgement

#### [John 8:1-11](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/8.1-11?lang=eng#p1) - Also good, but also raises some "whys?"

The woman taken in adultery

#### [John 8:31-36, 51](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/8.31-36,51?lang=eng#p31)

What does it mean to be a servant of sin? Can we, as sinners, be set free?

#### [John 9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/9?lang=eng) - Priority

Jesus heals a blind man on the Sabbath.

How are we like the disciples? How are we like the blind man?

How are the miracles of God made manifest through imperfect people? How have you seen God help you in big ways or small, despite your weaknesses?

#### [Luke 10: 25-37](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/10.25-37?lang=eng#p25) - Priority

Aside from teaching us about how to treat others, what does this parable teach us about judgment?
