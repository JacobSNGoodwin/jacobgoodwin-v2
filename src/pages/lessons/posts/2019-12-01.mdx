### Faith Without Works is Dead

- Read [James 2:14-26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/2.14-26?lang=eng#p14)

This passage is in the context of the importance of being impartial in our faith and merciful towards others.

<InfoContainer title="Discussion">

How have you observed faith in the lives of your friends or family?

How can we sometimes be like the person who tells others to "be warmed" instead of actually helping them to be warmed? Why do you think we can be like that sometimes? How do we overcome this tendency?What are some tangible ways we can live our faith?
