## Source Scriptures

### [1 Corinthians 14 - 2 Corinthians 7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng)

## Purpose of Spiritual Gifts - [1 Corinthians 14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng)

Read versus 1-4, 12, 19, 23-25

- What is Paul trying to say about the difference between the spiritual gifts of prophecy and of tongues?
- In what ways can these teachings influence how we focus our spiritual gifts in the church?

_In this chapter, Paul is specifically talking about a gift of tongues that is different than that manifested on the Day of Pentecost. On that occasion, the gift was given so that people of all nations could understand each other. In this case, one is receiving understanding or mysteries from God while babbling words unintelligible to others._

Can you have the gift of Prophecy?

- Guide to the Scriptures - [Prophecy](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/gs/prophecy-prophesy?lang=eng)
- Also see [Numbers 11:25-29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/11.25-29?lang=eng#p25)

- What are other spiritual gifts you or those you know have that can benefit the church? Have you found the spiritual gifts of others edifying?

## The Resurrection - [1 Corinthians 15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng)

Evidently, there were some of the church in Corinth that did not believe in the resurrection (verse 12). So Paul writes to remind people about this essential truth.

- v. 1-11 - Christ died for our sins, was buried, resurrected, and appeared to many, including Paul.
- Read v.12-22
  - Verse 19 is a personal favorite - other translations say something to the effect of "If we only have hope for Christ in this life, we are the most pitied of all people."
- v.29 - Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
  - Do you think about baptisms for the dead in terms of the resurrection? How can thinking about the resurrection enhance your experience of both live and vicarious baptisms?
  - Think about the symbolism of baptism.
- v.35, 38-44 - Answers the question "how (to what state) are the dead are raised?"
- v.57-58 - Be steadfast and immoveable, abounding in the work of the Lord

## Enduring Mortal Experience

[2 Corinthians 1:3-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/1.3-5?lang=eng#p3) - Christ comforts us. How does this serve us and others for the better?

- How have you been able to comfort someone else better because of what you have suffered (or the other way around)? Has this ever been a way to bring Christ's light and love to another?

[2 Corinthians 4:6-12,16-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/4.6-12,16-18?lang=eng#p7), [2 Corinthians 5:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/5.1?lang=eng#p1), [2 Corinthians 6:17 - 2 Corinthians 7:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/6.16-18?lang=eng#16)

- For what do our trials prepare us? How have your trials prepared you?

[2 Corinthians 5:6-11,17-21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/5.6-11,17-21?lang=eng#p1)

- We walk by faith, not by sight, while being away from God. We have a heavenly home in mind
- We can be reconciled to God by being made new in Christ
  - How are we made new in Christ?

[2 Corinthians 7:8-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/7.8-11?lang=eng#p8)

- Godly sorrow leads to repentance
