### [Title Page of the Book of Mormon](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/bofm-title?lang=eng)

[From Seminary Student Manual](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/book-of-mormon-study-guide-for-home-study-seminary-students-2013/unit-1-introductory-pages/unit-1-day-3-title-page-introduction-and-testimonies-of-witnesses?lang=eng)

_The Prophet Joseph Smith explained that the ancient prophet Moroni included the title page of the Book of Mormon on the gold plates: “The title-page of the Book of Mormon is a literal translation, taken from the very last leaf, on the left hand side of the collection or book of plates, which contained the record which has been translated, … and … said title page is not by any means a modern composition, either of mine or of any other man who has lived or does live in this generation” (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 60–61)._

- Moroni abridged the Book of Ether from Jaredite plates which were translated by Mosiah
  - These plates were found by expedition commissioned by King Limhi and led by Ammon (not the arm chopping Ammon) to find Zarahemla (his grandfather Zeniff had departed from Zarahemla which resulted in these Nephites being in bondage to Lamanites) - See [Mosiah 8:8-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8.8-9?lang=eng#p8)
- Words of Mormon are included to show that Mormon included the Small Plates of Nephi. Our account of Lehi is from the small plates because of the lost 116 pages of manuscript

#### Moroni's Commandments

Read first time Moroni gives commandment from [The Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/js?lang=eng)

If you are ambitious, I recommend reading [Saints, Volume 1, Part 1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/saints-v1/part-1?lang=eng)

#### Method of Translation

Joseph Smith described the translation being done by the gift and power of God. But what was the process like?

From Elder Russel M. Nelson [July, 1993 Ensign](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1993/07/a-treasured-testament?lang=eng)

_The details of this miraculous method of translation are still not fully known. Yet we do have a few precious insights. David Whitmer wrote:_

_“Joseph Smith would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see if it was correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man.” (David Whitmer, An Address to All Believers in Christ, Richmond, Mo.: n.p., 1887, p. 12.)_

- Joseph had both his own stone(s) and the pair of the stones recovered alongside the plates (set in silver "bows"). The latter were sometimes described as (large) spectacles.
- Church possesses a seer stone passed to Joseph down to Oliver Cowdery and eventually Brigham Young

### [The Testimony of Three Witnesses](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/three?lang=eng)

- In what way did the three witness the plates?

#### Context

Revelation to three witnesses found in [D&C 17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/17?lang=eng)

Martin Harris did not witness the plates at the same time as Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer. See the following _Revelations in Context_ articles and Church History essays for details.
