## Source Scriptures and Timeline

### [Acts 16-28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/16?lang=eng)

- When we last left off in Acts 15, the Apostles have had a conference and decided that the gentiles need not be burdened with the Jewish tradition of circumcision. After reporting this news to the believers in Antioch, Paul joins Silas to travel to cities where he preached on his first mission (and then some).
- Acts 16-18 - Paul's Second Missionary Journey
- Acts 19-21 - Paul's Third Missionary Journey
  - At the end of this section, Paul is nearly killed by a mob for "teaching against the law" and for being falsely accused of bringing Greeks into the temple. Soldiers save Paul and take him into custody. Before being carried away, the captain allows Paul to speak
- Acts 22 - Paul bears testimony to the crowd/mob in Jerusalem
- Acts 23 - Paul testifies before the Jewish council of Pharisees and Sadducees
  - Testifies of the resurrection, which stirs up a division
  - Holy Ghost tells Paul he will testify in Rome
- Acts 24 - Paul defends himself before Felix, the Roman governor/procurator over Judaea, in Caesarea
  - Paul kept in custody but given "some liberty" - Felix leaves Paul in prison for two years to do Jews a favor. It seems Felix was also hoping for a bribe from Paul.
  - Festus succeeds Felix
- Acts 25 - Jews try to get Festus to summon Paul to Jerusalem - In response, Paul appeals to Caesar (the emperor at the time was Nero)
- Acts 26 - Paul testifies to King Agrippa (of the Herodian dynasty) who visits Festus in Caesarea
- Acts 27 - Journey to Rome and shipwreck
  - Pretty good shipwreck story
- Acts 28 - Arrival in Rome, Paul preaches the gospel out of his own rented house while awaiting his hearing before Nero
- We know little from the bible about what happened to Paul after this period. In [Philippians 4:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philip/4.22?lang=eng#p22) the saints are greeted by those of Caesars household.
  - There are two major traditional narratives from early Christian writers. The first is that Paul returned to Rome and was killed (beheaded) by Nero. The second is that Paul traveled to Spain to preach the gospel.

<InfoContainer title="Spiritual Children of God">

Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles spoke of the importance of seeing ourselves first and foremost as spiritual children of God:

“Be careful how you characterize yourself. Don’t characterize or define yourself by some temporary quality. The only single quality that should characterize us is that we are a son or daughter of God. That fact transcends all other characteristics, including race, occupation, physical characteristics, honors, or even religious affiliation. …

“We have our agency, and we can choose any characteristic to define us. But we need to know that when we choose to define ourselves or to present ourselves by some characteristic that is temporary or trivial in eternal terms, we de-emphasize what is most important about us, and we overemphasize what is relatively unimportant. This can lead us down the wrong path and hinder our eternal progress” (“Be Wise” [Brigham Young University–Idaho devotional, Nov. 7, 2006], byui.edu).
