# Elders Quorum Lesson

**Gather Together in One All Things in Christ**

_February 24, 2019 - Jacob Goodwin_

## Summary Points

- The principle of gathering together in one all things in Christ can assist us in changing checklists into a unified, integrated, and complete whole. This applies to...
  - the doctrine, and living, of the Gospel of Christ
  - the progression/trajectory of Church programs and initiatives
  - us as members of the Church, or _body_, of Christ
- Through Christ, we have access in/by one spirit to the Father
  - **Maybe this explains Joseph Smith's commentary in that we differ in having the Gift of the Holy ghost**
- This togetherness, framed together, grows up unto a holy temple in the Lord
  - [Ephesians 2:21](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/2.21?lang=eng#p21)
  - [Ephesians 4:15-16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/4.15-16?lang=eng#p15)

::: warning To Think About

- What does (or might) gathering together in one all things in Christ look like for you on a daily basis?

  - Why can overly relying on checklists "divert us from drawing closer to the Lord"?
    - **There are definitely benefits to checklists. And in fact, I have personally struggled with the ministering program. Maybe this thought would be helpful for some class member, and perhaps encouragement or advice could be provided.**

- How do you remain focused in the gospel with fewer checklists and formal meetings?

- How do you avoid the potential isolation of a home-centered church?

  - **Perhaps that's the importance of going to the rescue, as taught by President Monson**

- What will help us to get along, be unified, and grow in love?
  - **Ephesians contains many great answers to this question such as...**
    - Not boasting of ourselves since we're all saved by grace
    - We have access by one spirit to the Father
    - Christ gave different gifts for the edifying of the body of Christ [1 Corinthians 12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng)
    - Should not walk in vanity

### [Gather Together in One All Things in Christ](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2018/10/gather-together-in-one-all-things-in-christ?lang=eng)

_Elder David A. Bednar - October 2018 General Conference - Saturday Morning Session_

::: tip Intertwined Strands
Just as a rope obtains its strength from many intertwined individual strands, so the gospel of Jesus Christ provides the greatest perspective of truth and offers the richest blessings as we heed the admonition of Paul to “gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.”
:::

::: tip A Segmented Gospel Approach Can Constrain
Sometimes as members of the Church we segment, separate, and apply the gospel in our lives by creating lengthy checklists of individual topics to study and tasks to accomplish. But such an approach potentially can constrain our understanding and vision. We must be careful because pharisaical focus upon checklists can divert us from drawing closer to the Lord.
:::

**[Elder Bednar](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2018/10/gather-together-in-one-all-things-in-christ?lang=eng) gives two examples of _gathering together in one--even in Him_**

When listening to or watching Elder Bednar speak, it's easy to miss the careful considerations and patterns he weaves into his messages. So let's read a little more carefully and see what we can learn!

- Example 1 - The fourth article of faith

- Example 2 - Church programs and initiatives

::: warning Questions for each example

- What are the individual strands?
- When the strands are intertwined, how do they provide a greater perspective for truth?
- Does understanding this unified truth make a difference, or is it merely intellectually intriguing?
  :::

::: tip An Apostolic Promise from Elder Bednar
I promise that increased perspective, purpose, and power will be evident in our learning and living of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as we strive to gather together in one all things in Christ—even in Him.

### [Ephesians](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph?lang=eng)

A principle theme of Ephesians is **"Christians, get along with each other!"** - [Daniel Wallace](https://bible.org/seriespage/ephesians-introduction-argument-and-outline)

This could be a pertinent lesson for our newly-formed ward.

For more on the body (church/followers) of Christ - [1 Corinthians 12-13](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng)

::: tip Ephesians 2 - Selected versus
8 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:

9 - Not of works, lest any man should boast.

14 - For he is our peace, who hath made both one (referring to converts/gentiles and long-time disciples), and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;

18 For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
:::

::: tip Ephesians 4 - Selected Versus
1 I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,

2 With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;

3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;

5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.

7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:

14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;

15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:

16 From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.

## Teacher Notes

### Elder Bednar

#### Example 1

- I see the principle and ordinances of the gospel as the strands (Faith, Repentance, Baptism, Laying on of hands, and continuing on the path Christ taught)
- When discussing each of these points I saw common words along with a progression. So progression and trust are important.
  - Faith is _trusting_ in Christ and placing confidence in His promises
  - If we trust, we want to repent and turn await from evil. We again _trust_ in Christ, _relying_ on Him to do what we cannot do for ourselves.
  - Baptism requires us also to _trust_ and _rely_, as well as to _follow_ Christ.
  - Laying on of hands -> _trust_, _rely_, _follow_, _press forward_ with the assistance of the Holy Spirit

::: tip Example 1 Summary Paragraph
The fourth article of faith does not simply identify the fundamental principles and ordinances of the restored gospel. Rather, this inspired statement of beliefs gathers together in one all things in Christ: trusting in and on Him, relying upon Him, following Him, and pressing forward with Him—even in Him.
:::

#### Example 2

- 1978 - Establish strong stakes by gathering the family of God and teaching them the ways of the Lord
  - More blessings for saints wherever they lived
- 1980 - Sunder meeting block consolidated
  - Personal and family responsibility for _learning, living, and teaching the gospel._
- 1995 - Re-emphasized with The Family: A Proclamation to the World
- 1998 - Small temples - bringing ordinances closer to Latter-day Saints
  - 2001 - PEF - Complemented by emphasis on temporal self-reliance
- President Monson - Go to the rescue
  - 2012 - Temporal preparation and self reliance initiatives in 2012
- Recent emphasis on the Sabbath Day - making it a delight in home and church
- Reorganization for ministering
- **Again we see a progression pattern** - Church programs are not an end in themselves

::: tip Example 2 Summary
I believe that the sequence and timing of these actions over many decades can help us to see one united and comprehensive work and not just a series of independent and discrete initiatives. “God has revealed a pattern of spiritual progress for individuals and families through ordinances, teaching, programs, and activities that are home centered and Church supported. Church organizations and programs exist to bless individuals and families and are not ends in themselves.”
:::

**How does this trajectory and progression inform how you should live your life?**

### Ephesians

- When talking about "predestination," the point is that we should praise God's glory [Ephesians 1:12](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/1.12?lang=eng#p12)
- Apostle prays that the spirit of wisdom will give knowledge through revelation [Ephesians 1:17-19](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/1.17-19?lang=eng#p17)
- We're saved by grace through faith and therefore shouldn't boast [Ephesians 2:8-9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/2.8-9?lang=eng#p8)
  - We need to remember this in our new ward family. It doesn't matter where we come from, or what position we might have held. We share in the same hope and have access to God by the same spirit.
  - Man in Cali. There are people coming from all background and they have something to contribute.
- As Christ made Jews and gentiles one (v.13), he can make us one and break down a wall of partition [Ephesians 2:14](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/2.14?lang=eng#p14)
- Through Christ we all have access by one Spirit unto the Father [Ephesians 2:18](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/2.18?lang=eng#p18)
- As fellow citizens, fitly formed together and based upon the foundation of Christ and His apostles and prophets, we grow unto a holy temple in the Lord. [Ephesians 2:21-22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/2.21-22?lang=eng#p21) - Also Ephesians 4
- There is one body and one spirit, one faith, one Lord, one baptism. [Ephesians 4:1-7](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/4.1-7?lang=eng#p1)
  - We walk worthy of the vocation of being called Christians with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering and forbearing (v.2)
- Gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers [Ephesians 4:11-17](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/eph/4.11-17?lang=eng#p11)
  - Ultimately for the edifying of the body of Christ and and the unity of the faith (which is a knowledge of the Son of God) (v.12-13)
  - whole body, with all its part working together, grows up in love
  - We should not walk in vanity - v 17
